# Depthai ROS Repository
Hi and welcome to the main depthai-ros respository! Here you can find ROS related code for OAK cameras from Luxonis. Don't have one? You can get them [here!](https://shop.luxonis.com/)

Main features:

* You can use the cameras as classic RGBD sensors for your 3D vision needs.
* You can also load Neural Networks and get the inference results straight from camera!

You can develop your ROS applications in following ways:

  * Use classes provided in `depthai_bridge` to construct your own driver (see `stereo_inertial_node` example on how to do that)
  * Use `depthai_ros_driver` package (currently available on ROS2 Humble and ROS Noetic) to get default experience (see details below on how) 

![](docs/multicam.gif)


Supported ROS versions:
- Noetic
- Humble
- Iron

For usage check out respective git branches.


### Install from ros binaries

Add USB rules to your system
``` bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03e7", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-movidius.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```
Install depthai-ros. (Available for Noetic, foxy, galactic and humble)
`sudo apt install ros-<distro>-depthai-ros`


## Install from source

### Install dependencies

The following script will install depthai-core and update usb rules and install depthai devices

``` bash
sudo wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luxonis/depthai-ros/main/install_dependencies.sh | sudo bash
```
if you don't have opencv installed then try `sudo apt install libopencv-dev`


if you don't have rosdep installed and not initialized please execute the following steps:
1. `sudo apt install python-rosdep`(melodic) or `sudo apt install python3-rosdep`
2. `sudo rosdep init`
3. `rosdep update`

### Setting up procedure
The following setup procedure assumes you have cmake version >= 3.10.2 and OpenCV version >= 4.0.0. We selected `dai_ws` as the name for a new folder, as it will be our depthai ros workspace.

1. `mkdir -p dai_ws/src`
2. `cd dai_ws/src`
3. `git clone --branch <ros-distro> https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ros.git`
4. `cd ..`
5. `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y`
6. `source /opt/ros/<ros-distro>/setup.bash`
7. `catkin_make_isolated` (For ROS1) `MAKEFLAGS="-j1 -l1" colcon build` (for ROS2)
8. `source devel/setup.bash` (For ROS1) & `source install/setup.bash` (for ROS2) 

**Note** If you are using a lower end PC or RPi, standard building may take a lot of RAM and clog your PC. To avoid that, you can use `build.sh` command from your workspace (it just wraps colcon commands):
`./src/depthai-ros/build.sh`

## Docker
You can additionally build and run docker images on your local machine. To do that, **add USB rules as in above step**.

### Running prebuilt images

Each tagged version has it's own prebuilt docker image. To download and run it:

```
xhost +local:docker
```
to enable GUI tools such as rviz or rqt.

Then
``` bash
docker run -it -v /dev/:/dev/  --privileged -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix luxonis/depthai-ros:noetic-latest [CMD]
```

Where [CMD] is what's going to be executed when container is initially run and could be for example:
- bash (it will allow you to browse files and make modifications to the code and rebuild it)
- zsh (other shell that is installed that has some advantages over bash)
- roslaunch depthai_ros_driver camera.launch (this is just an example, any launch file will work here)
A side note here, launch files in depthai_ros_driver have some default parameters set by .yaml files inside the driver. You can either edit them inside the container itself, or you can make a .yaml file on your host (let's say `/home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/params/example_config.yaml`) and pass it as an argument to the executable, as follows:
``` bash
docker run -it -v /dev/:/dev/ -v /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/params:/params --network host --privileged -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix luxonis/depthai-ros:noetic-latest roslaunch depthai_ros_driver camera.launch params_file:=/params/example_config.yaml
```
Note, to make images more compact only some external dependencies are installed, for example if you want to try out RTABMap example in docker, you have to:
- Install it by running the container in bash/zsh mode
- Modify the Dockerfile so that it's installed during building - you'll have to rebuild the container after that.
- Run base camera node in our container and RTABMap separately on host/ in a separate container (see the launch file on what parameters/topic names need to be changed when running separately).


### Building

Clone the repository and inside it run (it matters on which branch you are on):
``` bash
docker build --build-arg USE_RVIZ=1 -t depthai-ros .
```
If you find out that you run out of RAM during building, you can also set `BUILD_SEQUENTIAL=1` to build packages one at a time, it should take longer, but use less RAM.

`RUN_RVIZ` arg means rviz will be installed inside docker. If you want to run it you need to also execute following command (you'll have to do it again after restarting your PC):
``` bash
xhost +local:docker
```

Then you can run your image in following way:
``` bash
docker run -it -v /dev/:/dev/ --privileged -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix depthai-ros
```
will run an interactive docker session. You can also try:

``` bash
docker run -it -v /dev/:/dev/ --privileged -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix depthai-ros roslaunch depthai_examples stereo_inertial_node.launch.py
```
to run a launch file of your choice.

**NOTE** ROS2 Humble docker image uses Cyclone as RMW implementation.
### Running docker image on ROS1

``` bash
docker run -it -v /dev/:/dev/ --privileged -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix depthai_ros roslaunch depthai_examples stereo_inertial_node.launch
```
Will only start `stereo_inertial_node` launch file (you can try different commands).
### Running docker image on ROS2
``` bash
docker run -it -v /dev/:/dev/ --privileged -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix depthai_ros roslaunch depthai_examples stereo_inertial_node.launch.py
```


### Depthai ROS Driver

Currently, recommended way to launch cameras is to use executables from depthai_ros_driver package. 

This runs your camera as a ROS2 Component and gives you the ability to customize your camera using ROS parameters. 
Paramerers that begin with `r_` can be freely modified during runtime, for example with rqt. 
Parameters that begin with `i_` are set when camera is initializing, to change them you have to call `stop` and `start` services. This can be used to hot swap NNs during runtime, changing resolutions, etc. Below you can see some examples:


#### Publishing TFs from extrinsics

By default, camera transforms are published from default URDF descriptions based on CAD models. This can be overriden by using TFPublisher class from `depthai_bridge`, which based on Device's camera calibration data republishes the description with updated information. To enable this behavior in `depthai_ros_driver`, you can use following parameters:
- `camera.i_publish_tf_from_calibration` - setting this to true launches TFPublisher

Then you can set following arguments:
- `camera.i_tf_camera_name` - if not set, defaults to the node name
- `camera.i_tf_camera_model` - if not set, it will be automatically detected. If the node is unable to detect STL file for the camera it is set to `OAK-D`. To explicitly set it in `camera.launch.py`, set `override_cam_model:=true`
- `camera.i_tf_base_frame`
- `camera.i_tf_parent_frame`
- `camera.i_tf_cam_pos_x`
- `camera.i_tf_cam_pos_y`
- `camera.i_tf_cam_pos_z`
- `camera.i_tf_cam_roll`
- `camera.i_tf_cam_pitch`
- `camera.i_tf_cam_yaw`

When using `camera.launch.py`, you can set `pass_tf_args_as_params:=true` so that TF arguments are used to fill those parameters. For example `ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver camera.launch.py pass_tf_args_as_params:=true parent_frame:=map cam_pos_x:=1.0 imu_from_descr:=true`

It is also possible to set custom URDF path (for now only absolute path works) and custom xacro arguments using `camera.i_tf_custom_urdf_path` and `camera.i_tf_custom_xacro_args`. Please note that robot_state_publisher must be running.

**NOTE ON IMU EXTRINSICS**
If your camera has uncalibrated IMU, a warning will be shown, and IMU will be published with zero rotation and translation. You can override this behavior by setting `camera.i_tf_imu_from_descr`: true. This will publish default IMU extrinsics from URDF based on camera model.

#### Setting RGB parameters

By default RGB camera outputs `ISP` frame. To set custom width and height of output image, you can set `i_isp_num` and `i_isp_den` which scale image dimensions (2 and 3 by default, so from 1920x1080 to 1280x720), note for RGBD alignment to work resulting width and height must be divisible by 16. 

Additionally you can set `i.output_isp: false` to use `video` output and set custom size using `i_width` and `i_height` parameters.
![](docs/param_rgb.gif)
#### Setting Stereo parameters
![](docs/param_stereo.gif)
##### Depth alignment
When setting `stereo.i_align_depth: true`, stereo output is aligned to board socket specified by `stereo.i_board_socket_id` parameter (by default 0/CAM_A)

You can enable rectified Stereo streams by setting, for example in the case of right stream `i_publish_right_rect: true`. You can also set `i_publish_synced_rect_pair: true` to get both images with the same timestamps.

##### Custom Sensor sockets

Configuration of which sensors are used for computing stereo pair can be done either programatically, by specifying them in a constructor of a Stereo node (for example when building a custom pipeline), or via parameters - `stereo.i_left_socket_id`/`stereo.i_right_socket_id`. Please note that currently if you want to use rgb/center socket instead of one of the given pairs you will need to build a custom pipeline for that.

#### Feature Tracker

Each sensor node (and rectified streams from Stereo node) has the option to add FeatureTracker node, which publishes `depthai_ros_msgs/msg/TrackedFeatures` messages.
To enable features on, for example rgb node, set `rgb: i_enable_feature_tracker: true`. To enable publishing on rectified streams, set for example `stereo: i_left_rect_enable_feature_tracker`

#### Setting IMU parameters
Parameters:
* `i_acc_freq: 400` - Accelerometer sensor frequency
* `i_acc_cov: 0.0` - Accelerometer covariance
* `i_batch_report_threshold: 1` - Batch report size
* `i_enable_rotation: false` - Whether to enable rotation vector & magnetometer data (available when using IMU_WITH_MAGN/ IMU_WITH_MAGN_SPLIT message type)
* `i_gyro_cov: 0.0` - Gyroscope covariance
* `i_gyro_freq: 400` - Gyroscope frequency
* `i_mag_cov: 0.0` - Magnetometer covariance
* `i_mag_freq: 100` - Magnetometer frequency
* `i_max_batch_reports: 10` - Max reports per batch
* `i_message_type: IMU` - ROS publisher type:
  * `IMU` - sensor_msgs/Imu
  * `IMU_WITH_MAG` - depthai_ros_msgs/ImuWithMagneticField
  * `IMU_WITH_MAG_SPLIT` - two publishers - sensor_msgs/Imu & sensor_msgs/MagneticField
* `i_rot_cov: -1.0` - Rotation covariance
* `i_rot_freq: 400` - Rotation frequency
* `i_sync_method: LINEAR_INTERPOLATE_ACCEL` - sync method. Available options:
  * `COPY`
  * `LINEAR_INTERPOLATE_GYRO`
  * `LINEAR_INTERPOLATE_ACCEL`

#### Stopping/starting camera for power saving/reconfiguration
![](docs/start_stop.gif)

Stopping camera also can be used for power saving, as pipeline is removed from the device. Topics are also removed when camera is stopped.

As for the parameters themselves, there are a few crucial ones that decide on how camera behaves.
* `camera_i_pipeline_type` can be either 
  * `RGB` - only publishes RGB stream , NN available
  * `RGBD` - Publishes RGB + Depth streams (set `i_publish_topic` for left and right cameras to enable them), NN & Spatial NN available
  * `Stereo` - Publishes streams from left and right sensors, NN not available
  * `RGBStereo` - Publishes RGB + Left + Right streams, only RGB NN available
  * `Depth` - Publishes only depth stream, no NN available
  * `CamArray` - Publishes streams for all detected sensors, no NN available
This tells the camera whether it should load stereo components. Default set to `RGBD`.
It is also possible to create a custom pipeline since all types are defined as plugins. 

To do that, you can create a custom package (let's say `test_plugins`), create an executable in that package (`test_plugins.cpp`). Inside that file, define a cusom plugin that inherits from `depthai_ros_driver::pipeline_gen::BasePipeline` and overrides `createPipeline` method.

After that export plugin, for example:

```c++
#include <pluginlib/class_list_macros.hpp>
PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(test_plugins::Test, depthai_ros_driver::pipeline_gen::BasePipeline)
```
Add plugin definition:
```xml
<library path="test_plugins">
    <class type="test_plugins::Test" base_class_type="depthai_ros_driver::pipeline_gen::BasePipeline">
        <description>Test Pipeline.</description>
    </class>
</library>
```

Now you can use created plugin as pipeline, just set `camera.i_pipeline_type` to `test_plugins::Test`.

* `camera.i_nn_type` can be either `none`, `rgb` or `spatial`. This is responsible for whether the NN that we load should also take depth information (and for example provide detections in 3D format). Default set to `spatial`
* `camera.i_mx_id`/`camera.i_ip`/`camera.i_usb_port_id` are for connecting to a specific camera. If not set, it automatically connects to the next available device. You can get those parameters from logs by running the default launch file.
* `nn.i_nn_config_path` represents path to JSON that contains information on what type of NN to load, and what parameters to use. Currently we provide options to load MobileNet, Yolo and Segmentation (not in spatial) models. To see their example configs, navigate to `depthai_ros_driver/config/nn`. Defaults to `mobilenet.json` from `depthai_ros_driver`

To use provided example NN's, you can set the path to:
* `depthai_ros_driver/segmentation`
* `depthai_ros_driver/mobilenet`
* `depthai_ros_driver/yolo`

All available camera-specific parameters and their default values can be seen in `depthai_ros_driver/config/camera.yaml`.

Currently, we provide few examples:

* `camera.launch.py` launches camera in RGBD, and NN in spatial (Mobilenet) mode.
* `rgbd_pcl.launch.py` launches camera in basic RGBD configuration, doesn't load any NNs. Also loads ROS depth processing nodes for RGBD pointcloud.
* `example_multicam.launch.py` launches several cameras at once, each one in different container. Edit the `multicam_example.yaml` config file in `config` directory to change parameters
* `example_segmentation.launch.py` launches camera in RGBD + semantic segmentation (pipeline type=RGBD, nn_type=rgb)
* `pointcloud.launch.py` - similar to `rgbd_pcl.launch.py`, but doesn't use RGB component for pointcloud
* `example_marker_publish.launch.py` launches `camera.launch.py` + small python node that publishes detected objects as markers/tfs
* `rtabmap.launch.py` launches camera and RTAB-MAP RGBD SLAM (you need to install it first - `sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rtabmap-ros`). You might need to set manual focus via parameters here.

#### Specific camera configurations:
##### **PoE Cameras**
Since PoE cameras use protocol that has lower throughput than USB, running default camera launch can result in lags depending on chosen resolution/fps. To combat this issue, you can use encoded frames, which let you keep desired resolution/fps at the cost of image quality reduction due to compression. One additional difference is that `subpixel` depth filtering is disabled in this mode. To enable low_bandwidth, for example for rgb camera, change parameters:
* `rgb.i_low_bandwidth` - `true` to enable
* `rgb.i_low_bandwidth_quality` - desired quality % (default-50)
See `low_bandwidth.yaml` file for example parameters for all streams
##### **OAK D PRO W**
To properly align with depth, you need to set `rgb.i_resolution` parameter to `720` (see `config/oak_d_w_pro.yaml`).

#### Recalibration
If you want to use other calibration values than the ones provided by the device, you can do it in following ways:
* Use `set_camera_info` services available for each of the image streams
* Use `i_calibration_file` parameter available to point to the calibration file. **Note** camera name must start with `/`, so for example `/rgb`. See `depthai_ros_driver/config/calibration` for example calibration files. `calibration.launch` file is provided to start up a ROS camera calibrator node in both monocular and stereo configurations.
Calibration file syntax (from `camera_info_manager`):
```
    - file:///full/path/to/local/file.yaml
    - file:///full/path/to/videre/file.ini
    - package://camera_info_manager/tests/test_calibration.yaml
    - package://ros_package_name/calibrations/camera3.yaml
```

### Depthai filters

`depthai_filters` contains small composable node examples that show how to work with data from multiple topics.
Available filters:
- Detection2DOverlay - subscribes to `/nn/detections` and `rgb/preview/image_raw` topics. To see it in action, run
`ros2 launch depthai_filters example_det2d_overla.launch.py`. Note here - If you see that detections misalign in the overlay, adjust `rgb.i_preview_size` parameter.
- SegmentationOverlay, overlays semantic segmentation from `/nn/image_raw` on top of image from `rgb/preview/image_raw`, to see it in action, run
`ros2 launch depthai_filters example_seg_overlay.launch.py`
- WLS filter - stereo depth filter that smooths out overall depth image based on disparity data. It subscribes to `stereo/image_raw` and `left/image raw` topics. Parameters needed to enable it - `left.i_publish_topic`, `stereo.i_output_disparity`
an example can be seen by running  `ros2 launch depthai_filters example_wls_filter.launch.py`
- SpatialBB - publishes bounding boxes as 3D line Markers based on spatial detections coming from driver node
- FeatureTrackerOverlay - publishes Tracked Features overlay based on features and images coming from the driver
- Features3D - uses depth image to republish features as 3D pointcloud


### Using external sources for NN inference or Stereo Depth

There is a possibility of using external image topics as input for NNs or Depth calculation.

Example scenarios:

1. We want to get segmentation or 2D detection output based on images published by usb camera node.
This can be achieved by setting `rgb.i_simulate_from_topic` parameter to `true`. This creates `sensor_msgs/Image` subscriber listening by default on `/<node_name>/rgb/input` topic that passes data into the pipeline on each callback. Topic names can be changed either by classic ROS topic remapping or setting `rgb.i_simulated_topic_name` to a desired name.
By default, original sensor node still runs and publishes data. Setting `rgb.i_disable_node` to true will prevent it from spawning. Check `det2d_usb_cam_overlay.launch.py` in `depthai_filters to see it in action.

2. Calculating depth - both `left` and `right` sensor nodes can be setup as in the example above to calculate calculate depth/disparity from external topics. Note that for this to work properly you need specify:
- `left.i_board_socket_id: 1`
- `right.i_board_socket_id: 2` 
- Default stereo input size is set to 1280x720, in case of different image size, To set custom ones, set `stereo.i_set_input_size: true` and adjust `stereo.i_input_width` and `stereo.i_input_height` accordingly.
- external calibration file path using `camera.i_external_calibration_path` parameter. To get calibration from the device you can either set `camera.i_calibration_dump` to true or call `save_calibration` service. Calibration will be saved to `/tmp/<mx_id>_calibration.json`.
An example can be seen in `stereo_from_rosbag.launch.py` in `depthai_ros_driver`

### Developers guide

For easier development inside isolated workspace, one can use Visual Studio Code with DevContainers plugin, to do that:
- Create separate workspace
- Clone repository into src
- Copy `.devcontainer` directory into main workspace directory
- Open workspace directory in VSCode
